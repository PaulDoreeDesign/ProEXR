ext
=========

This directory holds git submodules that point to libraries needed by the ProEXR plug-ins.

You will need to manually add the [After Effects CS6 SDK](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/aftereffects.html) and the [Photoshop CS6 SDK](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshop/sdk.html).

If the submodule contents are missing, you should be able to get them by typing:

`git submodule init`
`git submodule update`
